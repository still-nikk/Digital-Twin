# Digital-Twin
Digital twins are a revolutionary concept that has emerged from industries such as aerospace and manufacturing. They provide virtual replicas of physical assets or systems, which are synchronized with real-time data from sensors and IoT devices. This empowers them to optimize operations, improve decision-making, and drive innovation across various sectors including healthcare, transportation, and smart cities. With their ability to bridge the gap between the physical and  digital realms, digital twins have the potential to transform industries by enabling personalized treatments, predictive interventions, and efficient infrastructure management. This marks the beginning of a new era of digital transformation and efficiency.

### DApps 
Decentralized applications (DApps) epitomize the diverse applications of blockchain technology. Operating on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, these applications function without a central governing body, utilizing smart contracts - self-executing contracts with predetermined rules embedded on the blockchain. DApps inherit the characteristics of blockchain, including transparency, immutability, and security, providing a broad spectrum of services ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to gaming, social media platforms, and identity verification systems. 

### Software Tool Platform / Tools / Framework used 
- Zbyte: A platform that provides everything needed to build, deploy, and operate dApps. 
- IPFS: All the user documents are uploaded to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a 
decentralized file system. 
- Cloudflare: Documents uploaded to the IPFS are fetched using the Cloudflare IPFS 
gateway to reduce document access time. 
- Smart Contracts (NFT Minter): Used for user-authentication, file tokenization and saving 
file to IPFS with user’s wallet address. 
- Javascript: Used to handle the required backened-related operations throughout our dApp.

### Functional requirements 
- Document Upload: Users must have the capability to securely upload digital documents to the platform. 
- Digital Twin Creation: Once a document is uploaded, the system must automatically generate a digital twin of the document using blockchain technology. 
- Ownership Tracking: The system must transparently track changes in document ownership by utilizing the immutable ledger of blockchain. 
- Authenticity Verification: Users should have the ability to verify the authenticity of documents through verification mechanisms based on blockchain.
- Integration with IPFS: Documents must be stored securely using IPFS, guaranteeing decentralized and resilient storage. 
- Smart Contract Integration: Smart contracts must be utilized to manage document ownership and facilitate secure transactions.

  ### Non-functional requirements 
- Security: The system must implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. 
- Scalability: The platform must be capable of handling a large volume of documents and users without compromising performance. 
- Reliability: The system must be highly reliable, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss. 
- Usability: The user interface must be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users to easily upload, retrieve, and verify documents. 
- Performance: The platform must have fast response times for document retrieval and verification operations. 
- Compatibility: The system must be compatible with various devices and browsers to ensure accessibility for all users. 

To summarize, the creation of a decentralized application (dApp) for digital twins using smart contracts and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) offers numerous benefits, such as decentralized storage, transparent transactions, and increased security measures. By following a structured approach during development, our dApp has not only demonstrated the potential to revolutionize digital twin ecosystems in various industries but has also showcased the practical application of blockchain technology and decentralized storage solutions.
